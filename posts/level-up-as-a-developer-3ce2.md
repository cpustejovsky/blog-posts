I'm not telling you **how** to level up as a developer. 

Frankly, becoming a better developer is a lot like becoming healthier. It's simply said but more difficult to do. To become healthier, eat better and exercise regularly. To level up as a developer, build things, contribute to open source projects, and dive deeper into the technologies you're using.

I'm not going to rehash that since there are plenty of others who offer better advice than I can. **I'm telling you to level up as a developer because you can!** Telling a bird to fly implies it can fly. Telling a fish to swim implies it can swim. And telling a developer to improve and grow implies they can. And you can.

If you're already working as a developer, it's like playing the main quest of an RPG. You are leveling up by doing what is in front of you. You may need to do side-quests as well, but that's a whole other discussion.

If you're just starting out or on the job hunt, you aren't as fortunate. Finding ways to gain experience and level up will take some work and some exploring. **But like there are random quests dotted along the map of most RPGs, there are people all over willing to look at your code and give you advice and point you in the right direction.**

I thought about this as I was creating a [landing page asking for feedback and critique of the app I'm working on](https://cpustejovsky.com/help/). If you can offer help, feel free to check it out and offer feedback. If you're in a similar boat as I am, take it as inspiration or an example of how to reach out and start leveling up as a developer.

**Most importantly, Good luck!**
