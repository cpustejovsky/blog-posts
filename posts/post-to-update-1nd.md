So I've wanted to start blogging more about JavaScript and programming.

The thing holding me back has been that I know that I do not know. 

I know I'm still relatively new and inexperienced.

I know I have plenty to learn.

To get rid of that excuse, I realized that I could open up my blog posts to feedback and edits.

I could connect them to GitHub and have make people make commits and issues and pull requests just like they would if I was coding something.

So I worked with [DEV's API](https://docs.dev.to/api/) to automate this process.

All of this was done with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), and [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

If you want to set up your own NodeJS application to use DEV.to's API, [here's a link to my repo](https://github.com/cpustejovsky/blog-posts)
