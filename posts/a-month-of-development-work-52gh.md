In February, I was given the opportunity to work with the Front End team at my company (BitPay) to help with the website. I was able to do the following with our Nuxt.js site:

* Created a QR transition for our home page that shows all of the cryptocurrencies we accept.
* Made CSS fixes for the homepage for Internet Explorer 11.
* Created a modal for when someone visits with Internet Explorer 11, directing them to upgrade to Microsoft Edge.
* Created a headless CMS using Ghost's content API for our website, mapping over Ghost's blog functionality, and paving the way for content heavy pages to be updated without interrupting developers.
* Rebuilt the press page to work with the headless CMS, allowing press releases to go live immediately and alleviating developer time spent manually updating the press page.
* Created cryptocurrency educational pages for SEO with a header component that will easily scale as my company accepts more cryptocurrencies.

More important than what I was able to accomplish was what I confirmed for myself.

Despite dealing with a decayed molar for the first half of the month, February 2020 was one of the greatest months of my life, and easily the greatest month of my professional life.

I'd get into work, have a cup of coffee, and start coding. I'd take a short break for lunch then jump back in. I'd end up wondering why I was so tired only to realize that I'd be been at it for over eight hours. The hours and days and weeks flew by.

Despite being tired from learning so much and putting my development skills to serious work, I began working on my personal projects at home with renewed discipline. 

During the month I was already looking at how to improve SEO, accessibility, and performance for the site as a whole once I finished the projects I described and got them on ship. I was already talking with the developers about how I could help with the dashboards once the site rebuild was complete.

So what did this month confirm for me? That this is my passion. That this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Not the rest of my career, the rest of my life.

I'm happier, I'm eating healthier, my entire life feels better. And it's easy to see why. I found my [ikigai](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#617337c62ed4) and have been able to do it for an entire month.
